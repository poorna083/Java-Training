/*Usecase
The parent class Car had a method called race(), which simply said "Car is racing" üöó.
Different car companies joined the race with their own unique racing styles.
A Ferrari  overrode the race() method to say "Ferrari races with blazing speed" üèé.
A Lamborghini  overrode it to say "Lamborghini races with roaring power" üî•.
A Tesla ‚ö° overrode it to say "Tesla races silently with electric power" üîã.
Even though the method name was always race(), the behavior changed at runtime.
The race announcer (like the JVM) didn‚Äôt know in advance which car‚Äôs style would appear.
When the cars came on track, the JVM decided at runtime which race() to execute.
Thus, Method Overriding allowed each car to show its own racing personality, while still following the same rule: race() .

Input Format
First line: Enter the number of cars (n).
Next n lines: Each line contains a car name (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Tesla, or Car).

Output Format
For each car entered, print its racing style using the race() method.
